	<p>Emma's Homeschool Help is a website (in-the-works, but who cares?) that is a center for homeschooling resources. You can find helpful review sites, worsheets, or videos for example. You can also find useful links like dictionary.com, as well as kiddle.com, if that's what you need. There are also fun games around here as well. SO what are you waiting for? Find something and feel free to get started! </p>
